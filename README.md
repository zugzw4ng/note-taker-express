## About

This program is designed for the user to be able to keep track of notes and tasks, and save them to revisit later, or delete them when no longer needed. It was built with provided front-end starter code, and I added the back-end with Express.js and Node. The app is hosted by Heroku and can be accessed via the deployed link.
